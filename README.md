# eSASS

This repository has two main components:

1. A clear, up-to-date eSASS user guide and usage tips, written to provide a starting point for those interested in preparing for analysis of eROSITA datasets. See further details at: https://amalyali.github.io/eSASS/ .

2. Python scripts for simulating eROSITA observations, preparing and calibrating data, and eSASS tasks.  

# To complete:
1. Add information to [Running eSASS](running_eSASS/overview.md), with information explaining why
we perform the steps we do and in that order.

2. Example scripts- how to reduce data spread across a large field of view (eg. multiple sky tiles).

3. Example scripts- how to analyse datasets with clusters

4. Example scripts- how to extract information about a specific region.

5. Example scripts- how to analyse a time-variable source.
